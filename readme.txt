--Readme document for Jonathan Vu, jonattv3@uci.edu

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- */1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */1 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- I have incorporated one portrait image with the use of alt attributes. 
- I have provided links to external pages such as a pdf to my resume and my social contacts. 
- I have provided appropriate headings and paragraph texts. 
- I have added custom icons from Google Material Icons as shown in my menu bar. 


(b) CSS features
- I have modified padding and margins to enhance readability across different screen layouts. 
- I have modified the colors on the page to make my portfolio visually appealing. 
- I've added my own custom fonts with appropriate fallbacks.


(c) Advanced features
- I have included a navigation bar to seamlessly navigate across my portfolio.



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
- I only have a few potential problems as highlighted with the accessibility checker; however, they don't seem like an accessibility concern as discussed below. 
- Potential Problem 1: Use a dir attribute to identify changes in text direction 
    - I did not intend to change directions in my text so this should not be an issue for those who need to hear the contents of my page. 
- Potential Problem 2: Image may contain text with poor contrast. 
    - My components are not too poor in contrast; if it is, it is a tradeoff that I can take to preserve the color palette that I intend on using. 
- Potential Problem 3: Document may be missing a skip to content link
    - I already address this problem with my menu bar which makes navigation easier for my users. 


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
- It took me roughly three hours to complete this project. 


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
- I've consulted with Generative AI to help complete this project and these are the queries that I used:
    - Build me a menu bar that has four buttons, rounded corners, responsive to different screen layouts, and has hovering functionality. Make it appealing. 


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
- I did not consult with any other individual for this assignment. 


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
- You may download the font styles in my public directory, but it is not necessary as I have incorporated fallback fonts.
